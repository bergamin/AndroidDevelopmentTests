# AndroidDevelopmentTests

This repository has a few android app examples by me and some from courses I've been taking on various platforms including Alura and Udemy. For example, the Java Contact List app is a modified version of an app from an Alura course, while the Kotlin version was my first contact with Kotlin development after learning a bit about it.

My objective here is trying some concepts from native development with Java and/or Kotlin and more recently, Flutter as well.

Alura courses publish their code here (PT-BR): https://github.com/alura-cursos

The only Udemy course being added here for now is the following (PT-BR):
https://www.udemy.com/curso-completo-flutter-app-android-ios

My code might considerily differ from the originals in these courses.

I have another dedicate repository for a lenghty Udacity course by Google here (EN-US): https://github.com/bergamin/udacity_google_kotlin_android_course

And another dedicate repository for an app using MVVM that's going to be a baseline for new development for me:
